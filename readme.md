# Mark Bosco's Web Visualizer
Version 1.0
5 January 2023

## Getting Started
Click [HERE](https://markb-nyp.github.io/WebVisualizer) to visualize your microphone input.
Remember to enable microphone permissions. None of your audio data is collected.

Hold a music player near the mic, sing, play an instrument, or connect an audio interface. The display on your screen will change in real time to match the audio input. See Controls section for additional options.

It works with MP3 files too. Some samples below:

## Controls
Click anywhere on the page to start.

Press 'o' to toggle visualization type.

Press 'l' to enable text bouncing. Text will shake based on the audio volume.

Press 'm' to trigger subtitle animation.

*Note: Cursor is hidden. This makes recording the visualizer on your screen easier. Use fullscreen mode (F11) for the best effect.*
